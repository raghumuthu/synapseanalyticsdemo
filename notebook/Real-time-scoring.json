Using the Cosmos DB Change Feed and [Spark Structured Streaming](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/spark/latest/structured-streaming/index.html), you will read the data being ingested into the Cosmos DB `transactions` container and use your trained machine learning model to predict whether each transaction is suspicious, in near-real-time, as it streams in. You will then write transaction data scored as `isSuspicious` and save that to a `suspicious_transactions` Cosmos DB container.\n",
